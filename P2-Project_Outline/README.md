## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Hidden Gem Travel App is a place to connect people who love the magic of finding new places. The idea came from a visit with a friend who is currently traveling the continental US in a camper. She has been trying to find local spots to rock climb in most places she stops, and she found that Yelp and Google were sending her places that were over-saturated with visitors. I started thinking about my own touring experience as a musician and how often I had to ask for advice on where to stop to eat, cool places to see, and fun things to do. The Hidden Gem Travel App would give locals the opportunity to submit their own favorite "hidden gem" spots, or places that aren't subject to rampant tourism. Especially as we are in a global pandemic, a wanderlust's itch can still be satisfied through less populated "hidden gems."

### Features
-post new spots
-follow/friend other travelers/locals
-review others' spots
-search hidden gems by zip code(and/or city name??)
-view hidden gems on map within certain radius of location and/or zip code
-populate newsfeed of friends/follows favorite spots (maybe feature spots? this might be too difficult)

### Technologies
-Java
-AWS EC2 instance
-Springboot
-mySQL
-Hibernate
-Some kind of map (I am leaning towards Google because of practicality, also because I ran into simple errors with StreetMaps address location)

### What I'll Have to Learn
-Logic surrounding some features, such as newsfeed, following others
-Populating databases with some pre-established data, allowing new additions to databases by other users
-Some geocoding, also spatial data??
-Spring Boot on an EC2 server
